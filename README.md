# Foundry Era Contracts

This repository contains a subset of zkSync [system contracts](https://docs.zksync.io/zk-stack/components/smart-contracts/system-contracts.html) for testing purposes. Once the [era-contracts](https://github.com/matter-labs/era-contracts/) GitHub repo releases a library edition, we will recommend people to use that instead. 

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This codebase is purely for testing purposes, and has not been audited, and should be used at your own risk.
